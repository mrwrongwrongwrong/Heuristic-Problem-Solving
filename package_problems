it is installed globally, but you might run your program in virtual environment, in this case it can't find 'requests' module

If you are getting "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'" error then it means either requests module is not installed or if it is installed then python is not able to find it.

Another reason is that you have installed multiple versions of python on your PC:

export PYTHONPATH="/the/path/you/want"
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.9"


THIS ONE WORKS!:
export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages"
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin


/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages -m pip install requests

export PATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages"

JUST USE LINUX SYSTEM!
