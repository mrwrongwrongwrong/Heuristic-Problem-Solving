it is installed globally, but you might run your program in virtual environment, in this case it can't find 'requests' module

If you are getting "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'" error then it means either requests module is not installed or if it is installed then python is not able to find it.

Another reason is that you have installed multiple versions of python on your PC:

sudo pip3 install requests

export PYTHONPATH="/the/path/you/want"
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.9"


THIS ONE WORKS!:
export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages"
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin


/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages -m pip install requests

export PATH="/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages"

JUST USE LINUX SYSTEM!

Update:
First, you have to know where your environment is located at, if you dont know, start a new virtual environment in Pycharm and record the location
Then:
export PATH="Your package location"
e.g 
export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Documents/Semesters/2021 Fall/heuristic problem solving/envir/lib/python3.9/site-packages"
/Users/zhousq/Documents/Semesters/2021\ Fall/heuristic\ problem\ solving/envir/lib/python3.9/site-packages -m pip3 install hps

Just open a terminal in the following repository:/Users/zhousq/Documents/Semesters/2021\ Fall/heuristic\ problem\ solving/envir/lib/python3.9/site-packages 
and 
pip3 install hps-nyu
brew install hps

---hps
https://pypi.org/project/hps-nyu/
pip3 install hps-nyu
